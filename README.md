Building a Number Guessing game by using Python

If someone asked you, “What exactly is programming anyway?” what could you say to them? Programming is just the action of writing code for programs, that is, creating programs that can be executed by a computer.

“But what exactly is a program?” When you see someone using a computer program (for example, playing your “Guess the Number” game), all you see is some text appearing on the screen. The program decides what exact text to show on the screen (the program’s output), based on its instructions and on the text that the player typed on the keyboard (the program’s input). A program is just a collection of instructions that act on the user’s input.

“What kind of instructions?” There are only a few different kinds of instructions, really.

1.  Expressions are values connected by operators. Expressions are all evaluated down to a single value, as 2 + 2 evaluates to 4 or 'Hello' + ' ' + 'World' evaluates to 'Hello World'. When expressions are next to the if and while keywords, you can also call them conditions.

2.  Assignment statements store values in variables so you can remember the values later in the program.

3.  The if, while, and break statements are flow control statements that can cause the execution to skip instructions, loop over instructions, or break out of loops. Function calls also change the flow of execution by jumping to the instructions inside of a function.

4.  The print() and input() functions. These functions display text on the screen and get text from the keyboard. This is called I/O (pronounced like the letters, “eye-oh”), because it deals with the Input and Output of the program.

And that’s it, just those four things. Of course, there are many details about those four types of instructions. In this book you’ll learn about new data types and operators, new flow control statements, and many other functions that come with Python. There are also different types of I/O such as input from the mouse or outputting sound and graphics instead of just text.

For the person using your programs, they only care about that last type, I/O. The user types on the keyboard and then sees things on the screen or hears things from the speakers. But for the computer to figure out what sights to show and what sounds to play, it needs a program, and programs are just a bunch of instructions that you, the programmer, have written.
